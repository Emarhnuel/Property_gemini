# Research Agent Crew Tasks - Sequential Process

scrape_listings:
  description: >
    Find and scrape property listings matching the criteria: {search_criteria}.

    PHASE 1 - DISCOVERY & SEARCH:
    1. Use Tavily Search to find property listings matching the criteria: {search_criteria}
       - Search for: "{search_criteria} listings" or "houses/apartments/hotels for rent in {search_criteria}"
    2. Do NOT restrict search to specific pre-defined platforms. Use whatever Tavily finds relevant.
    3. Identify 4 promising property listing URLs from the search results.
       
    PHASE 2 - EXTRACTION:
    1. For each identified listing URL, use Tavily Extract to get the page content.
    2. Extract the complete property details from the raw content.
    3. Document any pages that failed to load or were blocked.

    IMPORTANT:
    - STOP after collecting exactly 4 listings that match the user's criteria
    - Do NOT continue scraping once you have 4 valid listings
    - Do NOT scrape from social media (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, WhatsApp groups)
    - Only use dedicated property/hospitality websites found via Tavily Search
    - Check the date_listed or date_updated field for each property
    - SKIP properties listed more than 5 months ago from today's date
    - If no date is available, INCLUDE the property if it matches criteria
    - Only count listings that match the search criteria (location, property type, budget)
    - Include the platform source and url for each listing
    - If a platform blocks access, note it and move to alternatives
    - If you cannot find 4 matching listings, return what you found

    CRITICAL - MUST PRESERVE FIELDS (never drop these, even when summarizing):
    - images: Array of ALL image URLs from Tavily response and extracted pages
    - listing_url: The original property listing URL
    - contact: Any phone numbers, emails, or agent names found
