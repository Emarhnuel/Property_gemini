# Interior Design Crew Tasks Configuration

analyze_room_images:
  description: >
    Analyze the property images from the research results to identify:
    1. Room types (living room, bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, etc.)
    2. Current interior style and condition
    3. Key furniture and features present
    4. Recommended design improvements
    
    Use the "Generate Room Description" tool on each property image URL.
    
    Input: Research results containing property listings with image URLs.
    Process each property's images and compile analysis for use by the redesigner.
  expected_output: >
    A JSON object containing room analyses for each property:
    {
      "properties": [
        {
          "property_id": "...",
          "rooms": [
            {
              "image_url": "...",
              "room_type": "living room",
              "current_style": "...",
              "condition": "good",
              "redesign_suggestions": ["...", "..."]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }

generate_redesigns:
  description: >
    For each analyzed room, generate a redesigned visualization using AI image tools.
    
    Steps for each room:
    1. Use "Suggest Design Styles" to get appropriate style prompts for the room type
    2. Select the most suitable style based on the coordinator's analysis
    3. Use "Redesign Room Image" with the original image URL and style prompt
    4. Collect the redesigned images (base64) and descriptions
    
    Focus on creating compelling before/after transformations that help
    property seekers visualize the potential of each space.
  expected_output: >
    A JSON object with redesign results for each room:
    {
      "redesigns": [
        {
          "property_id": "...",
          "room_type": "living room",
          "original_image_url": "...",
          "style_applied": "Modern Minimalist",
          "redesigned_image_base64": "...",
          "description": "..."
        }
      ]
    }
  agent: room_redesigner

compile_design_report:
  description: >
    Compile all room analyses and redesigns into a comprehensive design report.
    
    The report should:
    1. List each property with its ID and location
    2. For each property, show all rooms with before (original) and after (redesigned) images
    3. Include style descriptions and design notes
    4. Provide a summary of transformations completed
    
    Ensure the report is well-structured JSON that can be consumed by the frontend.
